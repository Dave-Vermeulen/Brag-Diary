# Brag Diary - 2025-08-30

## Challenge
It bothers me day in and day out that as parents we dont all get along, our communication has broken down. The part that weights the heaviest is that our kid is being negatively affected by the brwn, she tells me she is confued.

## Achievement
we have managed to decrease confusion for our daughter by 2 out of 3 parents focusssing on a modal that does not discuss adult issues. her mother has also expressed interest in using play therapy to help her.

## Estimated Time
100000000000 hours
